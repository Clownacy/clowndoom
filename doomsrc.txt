Description             : This is a copy of the source code for DOOM's
                          executable, v1.10 (public release version).
                          This source code was initially released under
                          the DOOM license in 1997, but then dual licensed
                          (DOOM/GPL) in 1997 to encourage transparency in
                          the development of ports and extensions of the
                          DOOM game engines. A copy of the source under the
                          DOOM license may be obtained at id Software's
                          FTP, or at one of its mirrors on /idgames in the
                          /idstuff/source directory.

Additional Credits to   : Everyone who's contributed to the understanding
                          and development of the DOOM source code, and Bernd
                          Kreimeier for preparing the source for release.
