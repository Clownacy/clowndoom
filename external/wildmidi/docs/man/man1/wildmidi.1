.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a demonstration program to show the capabilities of libWildMidi.
.PP
\fImidifile\fP can be a MIDI type file in the HMI, HMP, MIDI, MUS or XMI formats and is processed by libWildMidi and the resulting audio is output by the player.
.PP
You can have more than one \fImidifile\fP on the command line and \fBwildmidi\fP will pass them to libWildMidi for processing, one after the other. You can also use wildcards, for example: \fBwildmidi *.mid\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-b\fP | \fB\-\-reverb\fP"
Turns on an 8 point reverb engine that adds depth to the final mix.
.P
.IP "\fB\-c\fP \fIconfig\-file\fP | \fB\-\-config\fP \fIconfig\-file\fP"
Uses the configuration file stated by \fIconfig\-file\fP instead of /etc/wildmidi/wildmidi.cfg
.PP
.IP "\fB\-d\fP \fIaudiodev\fP | \fB\-\-device=\fIaudiodev\fP"
Send the audio to \fIaudiodev\fP instead of the default. ALSA defaults to the system "default" while OSS defaults to "/dev/dsp". Other environments do not support this option.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-h\fP | \fB\-\-help\fP"
Displays command line options.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-f\fP | \fB\-\-frequency\fP"
Use frequency F Hz for playback (MUS).
.PP
.IP "\fB\-g\fP | \fB\-\-convert\fP"
Convert XMI: 0 - No Conversion (default)
             1 - MT32 to GM
             2 - MT32 to GS
.PP
.IP "\fB\-l\fP | \fB\-\-log_vol\fP"
Some MIDI files have been recorded on hardware that uses a volume curve, making them sound really badly mixed on other MIDI devices. Use this option to use volume curves.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-m\fP \fIvolume\-level\fP | \fB\-\-mastervol=\fIvolume\-level\fP"
Set the overall volume level to \fIvolume\-level\fP. The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 127, with the default being 100.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-o\fP \fIwav\-file\fP | \fB\-\-wavout=\fIwav\-file\fP"
Records the audio in wav format to \fIwav-file\fP.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-r\fP \fIsndrate\fP | \fB\-\-rate=\fIsndrate\fP"
Set the audio output rate to \fIsndrate\fP. The default rate is 32072.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-n\fP | \fB\-\-roundtempo\fP"
Round tempo to nearest whole number.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-s\fP | \fB\-\-skipsilentstart\fP"
Skips any silence at the start of playback.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-v\fP | \fB\-\-version\fP"

.PP
.IP "\fB-k\fP \fIN\fP | \fB\-\-test_bank=\fIN\fP"
Set the test bank to \fIN\fP. Range is 0 to 127.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-p\fP \fIN\fP | \fB\-\-test_patch=\fIN\fP"
Set the test patch to \fIN\fP. Range is 0 to 127.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-t\fP | \fB\-\-test_midi\fP"
Plays the built in test midi which plays all 127 notes.
.PP
.SH USER INTERFACE
The player accepts limited user input that allows some interaction while playing midi files.
.PP
.IP \fB\+\fP
Turns the master volume up.
.PP
.IP \fB\-\fP

.PP
.IP \fBe\fP
Turns enhanced resampling on and off.
