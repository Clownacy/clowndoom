.SH NAME
WildMidi_GetInfo \- get information on a midi
.SH LIBRARY
.B libWildMidi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <wildmidi_lib.h>
.PP
.B struct _WM_Info *WildMidi_GetInfo (midi *\fIhandle\fP);
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Obtains information allowing you to determine song position, current options, and any copyright information.
.PP
.IP \fIhandle\fP
The identifier obtained from opening a midi file with \fBWildMidi_Open\fR(3)\fP or \fBWildMidi_OpenBuffer\fR(3)\fP
.PP
.SH RETURN VALUE
On error returns NULL with an error message displayed to stderr.
.PP
Otherwise returns a pointer to a struct containing the information.
.PP
.nf
struct _WM_Info {
   char *\fIcopyright\fP;
   uint32_t \fIcurrent_sample\fP;
   uint32_t \fIapprox_total_samples\fP;
   uint32_t \fItotal_midi_time\fP;
   uint16_t \fImixer_options\fP;
   uint32_t \fItotal_midi_time\fP;
};
.fi
.PP
.IP \fIcopyright\fP
A pointer to a \\0 terminated string containing any copyright MIDI events found while processing the MIDI file \fIhandle\fP refers to. If more than one copyright event was found then each one is separated by \\n
.PP
If \fIcopyright\fP is NULL then no copyright MIDI events were found.
.PP
.IP \fIcurrent_sample\fP
This is the number of stereo samples libWildMidi has processed for the MIDI file referred to by \fIhandle\fP. You can use this value to determine the current playing time by dividing this value by the \fIrate\fP given when libWildMidi was initialized by \fBWildMidi_Init\fR(3)\fP.
.PP
.IP \fIapprox_total_samples\fP
This is the total number of stereo samples libWildMidi expects to process. This can be used to obtain the total playing time by dividing this value by the \fIrate\fP given when libWildMidi was initialized by \fBWildMidi_Init\fP\fR(3).\fP Also when you divide \fIcurrent_sample\fP by this value and multiplying by 100, you have the percentage currently processed.
.PP
.IP \fItotal_midi_time\fP
This is the total time of MIDI events in 1/1000's of a second. It differs from \fIapprox_total_samples\fP in that it only states the total time within the MIDI file and does not take into account the extra bit of time to finish playing sampling smoothly.
.PP
.IP \fImixer_options\fP
.RS
.IP WM_MO_LOG_VOLUME
Using curved volume settings instead of linear ones.
.PP
.IP WM_MO_ENHANCED_RESAMPLING
The enhanced resampler is active
.PP
.IP WM_MO_REVERB
Reverb is being added to the final output.
