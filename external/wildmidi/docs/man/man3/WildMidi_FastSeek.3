.SH NAME
WildMidi_FastSeek \- Move to a position in a midi file
.PP
.SH LIBRARY
.B libWildMidi
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <wildmidi_lib.h>
.PP
.B int WildMidi_FastSeek (midi *\fIhandle\fB, unsigned long int *\fIsample_pos\fB);
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Resets all note specific midi states and active notes before scanning to \fIsample_pos\fP samples from the beginning taking note of any changes to midi channel states. The next call to \fIWildMidi_GetOutput\fP\fR(3)\fP will behave as if you started to play the midi from that position.
.PP
.IP \fIhandle\fP
The identifier obtained from opening a midi file with \fBWildMidi_Open\fR(3)\fP or \fBWildMidi_OpenBuffer\fR(3)\fP
.PP
.IP \fIsample_pos\fP
The number of samples from the beginning you want libWildMidi to seek to.
.PP
NOTE: significant delay can occur when using this function. You can expect even more delay if you select a position that's already been passed forcing the library to start from the beginning.
