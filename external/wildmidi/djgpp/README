This directory contains the Makefile and config.h needed to compile
libWilMidi library and wildmidi player for DOS using DJGPP.


To compile, you need DJGPP library and its associated compiler suite.
Both djgpp-v2.03 and v2.05 should work.  DJGPP is available from its
official site at <http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/>
Cd in to the djgpp directory and run 'make', i.e.:

  cd djgpp
  make

.. which will generate libWildMidi.a and wildmidi.exe.  If necessary,
edit the Makefile to meet your needs/environment.


The player (wildmidi.exe) can either output to a Sound Blaster (SB1,
SB2, SBPro, SB16, or compatible) hardware:

  wildmidi mymidi.mid

... or, it can generate a wav file:

  wildmidi -o output.wav mymidi.mid

Use -r <SampleRate> to specify a sample rate, use -c <ConfigFile> to
point to your wildmidi.cfg config file:

  wildmidi -c c:\wildmidi.cfg -r 22050 mymidi.mid

Run "wildmidi -h" to see other command line switches.
